# UCLI Development Ideas

## Core Design Principles

* **Modular Integration**: UCLI should be easy to implement into any application using a defined SPI (Service Provider Interface) and API. Applications can register commands, handlers, and metadata via a plugin interface.

* **Standalone Operation**: UCLI can be launched as a standalone overlay application running above all others, acting as a universal command center.

* **Command Suggestions & Autocompletion**:

  * Include an engine to suggest and autocomplete inputs.
  * Suggestions should prioritize commonly used commands and those that match contextually.

* **Security Architecture**:

  * UCLI must have a robust security layer.
  * Implement proper user authentication and permission scopes for interacting with various APIs and resources.

* **Efficiency First**:

  * Every command and interaction must be justified.
  * Avoid wasting user time compared to traditional UIs.
  * The system must respond quickly and minimize overhead.

## Technical Concepts

* **URI-Based Interface**:

  * UCLI uses a URI scheme to represent resources and actions (e.g., `md://b/table`).
  * URIs are universal and can be used to reference anything from files to web APIs.

* **Shell Wrapper**:

  * UCLI functions as a wrapper over a standard shell.
  * It can serve both as a simple CLI and as an enhanced UCLI shell with additional capabilities.

* **UCLI Shell Modes**:

  * The default shell behaves like a traditional terminal.
  * UCLI introduces its own shell mode with UI elements and keyboard triggers.
  * Use `:` prefix for internal UCLI commands.
  * Use `:!` or key shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+Esc, Ctrl+E) to exit to basic shell mode.

## Productivity Features

* **Boilerplate Commands and Snippets**:

  * Introduce shortcuts for inserting common templates, code snippets, and document structures.
  * Example: `ucli md://b/table` inserts a basic Markdown table.
  * These are like advanced copy-paste operations, but more dynamic and context-aware. They work across environments, not just in text editors.

## Use Cases

* **Learning CLI Tools**: UCLI can serve as a tutorial layer over standard shells, guiding users through learning `bash`, `vim`, and `grep` with real examples and contextual help.

* **Daily Automation**: Automate file organization, backups, or note-taking using consistent commands across different apps (e.g., `ucli fs://documents --sort date`).

* **Cross-Application Scripting**: Query data from one tool and send it to another using URIs and pipes (e.g., `gdrive:/photos?date=today | localfs:/backup/photos`).

* **Self-Analytics**: Fetch personal banking data or logs and process them via CLI pipelines (e.g., `monobank:/statement?last=7d | $chatgpt 'Summarize my spending'`).

* **Boilerplate Insertion**: Quickly insert common document structures, code templates, or config snippets (e.g., `ucli md://b/meeting-notes`).

* **Multi-Source Personal Analysis with LLM**: Aggregate data from multiple URIs and instruct an LLM to analyze it and generate structured content. Example:

  ```bash
  fitbit:/steps?range=last30d | monobank:/expenses?range=last30d | $chatgpt 'Generate a monthly health and budget summary with recommendations'
  ```

  This combines health metrics and financial data into a personalized, human-readable report generated by the AI.
